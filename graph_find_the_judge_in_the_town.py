'''
In a small town, N people are marked from 1 to N. There is a rumor that one of these people is a secret judge in the town.

If the judge of the town really exists, then:
 - The judge in the town doesn't believe anyone.
 - Everyone (except the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 - Only one person satisfies Attribute 1 and Attribute 2 at the same time.

Given a list of trust, the list consists of trust pairs trust[i] = [a, b], which means that the person labeled a trusts the person labeled b.
If there is a secret judge in the town and his identity can be determined, please return the judge's mark. Otherwise return -1.

Input format:
The input consists of two lines:
the first line is a positive integer N, the second line is the trust pairs' list, given as a legal Python expression

Output format:
An integer representing the judgeâ€™s number

Input sample:
4
[[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]

Sample output:
3
