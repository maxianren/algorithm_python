'''
Calculate how many events occurred in the past 10,000 milliseconds, including the current event;
that is, for each element k in the list, calculate how many elements in the entire list are between k-10000 and k (Both ends are included).

Input format:
A sorted list mylist, all elements are non-negative integers, record the occurrence time of each request, the unit is milliseconds.

Output format:
A list of the same length as mylist.

Input sample:
[0,10,100,1000,10000,20000,100000]

Sample output:
[1,2,3,4,5,2,1]
